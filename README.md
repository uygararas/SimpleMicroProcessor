# SimpleMicroProcessor
A simple microprocessor designed in system-verilog.
This is the end-term project of my CS-223 Digital Design course.
Objective of this course was to learn the basic architecture of the Computer and the at the end of the term after completeing 5 labs we have given a project to desing a simple microprocessor.
The files include source codes, constraint files and testbenches for this project.
The pdf file includes the project description.
